# Lu4H11N_wannier_Hr
The projected to Wannier functions Hamiltonian for LuH3âˆ’xNy newest apparent near-ambient superconductor with x=y=0.25 (Lu4H11N).

The calculations were performed within the GGA+U approximation in the VASP software package.

We consider the nitrogen doped lutetium hydride LuH2.75N0.25 with the spatial symmetry group Fm-3m and lattice parameter a = 5.0289 A at ambient pressure.

In order to define the minimal orbital basis set for LuH2.75N0.25 to reproduce electronic bands near the Fermi level we performed the projection onto Wannier functions.
It is determined that to get a good agreement between those bands one needs to include the H-1s state of three H atoms in octahedral surrounding and the N-2p states of the N atom.
The bands built on the Wannier functions coincide well enough near the Fermi level with the original DFT bands
